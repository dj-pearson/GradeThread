# PENDING MIGRATIONS — apply BEFORE pushing this branch to origin

> Running package for the current pre-launch loop. Local `main` is **N commits
> ahead of `origin/main` and intentionally NOT pushed** until you review. At
> check-in, apply any migrations below to prod (DB → edge → frontend order per
> DEPLOY.md), redeploy the edge (Coolify), then give the OK to `git push`.

## How to apply
1. Apply each migration SQL below to prod in listed order (they're idempotent).
   Or run `scripts/apply-prod-migrations.sh` if you prefer the scripted path.
2. Redeploy the edge service on Coolify so `EXPECTED_SCHEMA_VERSION` matches.
3. `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';` if any table/column/RPC changed.
4. Tell me "OK to push" — I'll `git push origin main`.

## Status: ✅ NO PENDING MIGRATIONS

Stories completed so far this loop are **code-only** (no schema changes):

| Story | Migration? | Schema bump? |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| US-1505 (eBay specifics string[] normalize) | none | none |
| US-1506 (End-listing truthfulness) | none | none |

`EXPECTED_SCHEMA_VERSION` unchanged at **00331**; latest migration file is
`00331_fix_users_guard_bogus_moderation_cols.sql`. Next migration, when one is
needed, is `00332`.

_This file is updated as the loop progresses — check it at every check-in._
