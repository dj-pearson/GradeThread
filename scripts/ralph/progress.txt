## US-022: Database migration: add inventory and financial tracking tables
- Status: COMPLETE
- Files changed: supabase/migrations/00002_inventory_financial.sql, prd.json, scripts/ralph/prd.json
- Notes: Created migration with 2 new enums (item_status, listing_platform), 4 new tables (inventory_items, listings, sales, shipments). All tables have UUID PKs, proper FK constraints (CASCADE on delete, SET NULL for optional refs), indexes on all FKs and status columns, RLS policies enforcing ownership through the inventory_items -> user_id chain, and set_updated_at triggers on tables with updated_at columns. Sales table intentionally has no updated_at (immutable records). Shipments RLS uses a JOIN through sales to inventory_items for ownership verification.
