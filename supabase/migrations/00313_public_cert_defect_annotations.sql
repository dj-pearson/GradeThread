-- US-1287: expose per-defect bounding boxes on the PUBLIC certificate view.
--
-- The grader already localizes most defects to a normalized [x,y,w,h] box,
-- persisted in grade_reports.per_image_analysis (DetectedIssue.bbox). The cert
-- page renders defects as a text list only — the boxes are stored but never
-- drawn. This appends a sanitized `defect_annotations` column to the public
-- view so the certificate can draw PSA-style callouts over the photos.
--
-- NO new PII: the projection exposes ONLY genuine (non-intentional), LOCALIZED
-- defects' issue + severity + location + bbox — the exact same condition facts
-- already public via `defects_found` and the photo gallery. The raw
-- per_image_analysis trace (condition_signals, defect_type, size/confidence,
-- internal notes) stays server-side, as it did before this migration.
--
-- CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW can only APPEND columns (never drop/reorder), so the
-- full current column set from 00312 is reproduced verbatim and the new column
-- is appended last; the FROM/WHERE (finalized-only) is unchanged. Omitting any
-- existing column here raises 42P16 "cannot drop columns from view".
