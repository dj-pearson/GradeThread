## 3. Logo Usage

The GradeThread logo is a typographic mark designed for clarity.

### Variations
1.  **Primary Logo**: Dark Navy text (`#1A1A2E`) with the Red accent (`#E94560`). Best on light backgrounds.
2.  **White (Reverse) Logo**: White text (`#FFFFFF`) with the Red accent (`#E94560`). Best on dark backgrounds (like `#0F3460` or `#1A1A2E`).
3.  **Icon**: A simplified "GT" mark or symbol using the primary colors.

### Clear Space
Maintain a minimum clear space around the logo equal to the height of the "G" in GradeThread to ensure legibility.
